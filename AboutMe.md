Ever since I was a child, I have had an interest in computers since my parents bought their own first personal computer. While I was interested in computers it was not until my enrollment in Appalachian State University that I discovered my passion of software engineering. From writing my first Main function in Java my curiosity grew as I discovered all the possibilities that different languages had when combined with complex data structures and algorithms.  

Now as I near my graduation from Appalachian State University, I see how much more there is to learn about this field and that this process of learning has no end. Looking to enter the professional industry, I am excited to continue this learning process and to develop myself professionally.
